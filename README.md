# hello-world
Hello, my name is Rhian Benjamin and I am a Computer Information Systems student. I currently work as a Administrative Assistant by day and go to school in the night. In my free time, I’m currently trying to organize myself to self-learn everything I need to become a software engineer. I’m dedicating everyday towards my career path to become one of the best. In my README file, I will share my plans as to how I plan on achieving my goal and the future projects I have in mind. If you are reading this, follow me along my journey until we’ve reached the end (there is no end in learning).

# Software Engineer Career Path

## Background

I've always been interested in web development so I've learnt a bit about HTML, CSS3, JavaScript and BootStrap. In terms of basics, I believe I have it covered. However, my knowledge on Python and Java is a bit blurry but I know once I start to practice everyday, I'll be better. 

## Overview

Overall, I'd like to be proficient in the following languages by the end of the year:

1. HTML, CSS3
2. JavaScript - Node.js, React.js
3. MongoDB
4. Python
5. Web3
6. DApps

To achieve learning these languages, I will be using Udemy courses, YouTube videos, reading books, and practice, practice, practice!

After I've completed this milestone, I will create a portfolio that'll contain my projects. Anything that comes to mind, I will add to the projects area below.

## Learning

I will be creating a strict schedule that will allow me to put enough time in practicing, and still allow me to balance school and work at the same time. This is trial and error until I figured out the perfect schedule to ensure I am meeting deadlines. The table below is a draft of the hours I'll put in on a weekly basis.
