# hello-world
Hello, my name is Rhian Benjamin and I am a COmputer Information Systems student. I currently work as a Administrative Assistant by day and go to school in the night. In my free time, I’m currently trying to organize myself to self-learn everything I need to become a software engineer. I’m dedicating everyday towards my career path to become one of the best. In my README file, I will share my plans as to how I plan on achieving my goal and the future projects I have in mind. If you are reading this, follow me along my journey until we’ve reached the end (there is no end in learning).
